<p>Personally, I found meeting with my SCRUM group to be very helpful. Everyone has a different design esthetic, so it is important to get other viewpoints. 
By the team we met with our groups to discuss design, I had almost completely finished my portfolio, so I went into our meeting thinking I wouldn't have much to change.
However, my group presented a lot of good advice on my design, critiquing some different aspects of my layout and graphics. One thing my group really focused on was how some of my text over-lapped my pictures.
Personally, I wanted the graphic to look this way, but, after a lot of debate, I did end up agreeing with my team that the over-lapping make the text difficult to read. So I did eventually end up changing my graphic.
Additionally, my group also pointed out some spacing issues I had, of which I quickly fixed. Sometimes I was a bit stubborn, sticking behind my designs, but after a while I did realize that their suggestions were for the best.</p>

<p>I believe that my SCRUM group worked well together and used our time efficiently. We all used constructive criticism on each others' designs, as we realized that this exercise was to only benefit our portfolios.
I think I was able to provide solid advice to some of my team members, and I believed that their critiques benefit me. They really set up my tasks for the next few weeks as I completed my portfolio.
In the end, my portfolio ended up almost exactly how I wanted it and I am actually pretty proud of it. I have even shown it in a job interview, of which I got the job for.</p>

<p>As any resourceful person of my generation, Google was my best resource for this project. As I worked on my portfolio piece by piece, I used Google and online resources to learn different HTML and CSS techniques.
There are many useful and easy to understand resources out there, but my favorite was probably W3School. On W3School they have a lot of information on HTML and CSS syntax, which is my biggest obstacle.
In addition to only resources, I also turned to my fellow classmates if I needed help. Katie and Lizzie were especially great and very willing to help.</p>

<p>I found the SCRUM workshops to be very beneficial, as I always enjoy working in groups and bouncing ideas off of each other. Everyone has a different viewpoint, so it is important to see different sides of the situation.</p>
