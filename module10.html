<p>Though there was a steep learning curve for me in regards to HTML and CSS, I am currently very satisfied with how my portfolio is. This weekend I put a lot of time into reorganizing my site, which as a result made my CSS and HTML much more easy to read.
When creating my site I decided to create the structure in HTML first, which was highly beneficial. Then I made my CSS around that. Because I decided to have my website be the same structure universally, with only the content changing throughout, HTML coding has been relatively easy since I created the original structure. The only thing I have to change is the content tag.
I think that this has helped me keep my content away from my design. This is because I don't have to change my CSS from page to page, as they have a universal layout, so all I have to edit is my HTML. This keeps me from trying to place design elements within my HTML coding.</p>

<p>However, it did not start out this smooth sailing. At first I was relying on copying and pasting a lot of code from the internet to create my website. Because I was copying and pasting, I was putting it all in the wrong tags, across CSS and HTML, and the site was not pretty.
This weekend, however, I made sure to clean this all up, and delete any coding in which I did not understand the function of or had written myself.</p>

<p>Despite this, I will not claim that my site is perfect, as it is far from it. I am still having a hard time aligning certain elements of my website into the way I want them to be. My SRUM teammates also agree that this is my main problem. I am still trying to figure out whether it is my HTML or my CSS that is the problem, but I currently believe that it is my CSS.
I have a lot of floating blocks to create my website structure, and sometimes they can overlap. That is one of the main elements that I am still trying to code properly. Another element in which I am still working on perfecting is padding. My CSS in regards to padding is all over the place, and I am currently trying to figure out how to space it all to perfection.</p>

<p>Going further into my HTML and CSS markup, I will know to be more careful with editing and implementation. At first I was throwing code this way and that, but now that I have my proper barings, I believe I know what I am doing.
In fact, I am actually starting to like to code, and often find myself working on my website in my free time. I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty proud of it. Check it out! http://itschrisryan.host22.com</p>
